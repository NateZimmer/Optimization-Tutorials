The following is my personal reference repository of math examples and concepts that I have found to be useful. The following list introduces various topics as well as provides examples. 

1. [**Least Squares**](Pages/LeastSquares.md)
2. [**Levenberg Marquardt**](Pages/LevenbergMarquardt.ipynb) 
3. [**Kalman Filter**](Pages/KalmanFilter.md)
4. [**Recursive Least Squares**](Pages/RecursiveLeastSquares.md) 
5. [**Gauss Newton**](Pages/GaussNewton.ipynb) 
6. [**Gradient Descent**](Pages/GradientDescent.md) 
7. [**NLSQ With Multiple Datasets**](Pages/NonLinearMultipleDataSets.md) 
8. [**Signal Reconstruction by Time Stamp**](Pages/DataSampling.md) 


**Discliamer:** These tutorials may be chalk full of errors and may be utter rubbish. These tutorials represent my limited understanding of these topics and should not be used as any type of a definitive reference.
